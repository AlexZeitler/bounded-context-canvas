# Bounded Context Canvas how to

The *bounded context canvas* is described in [this blog post](https://medium.com/nick-tune-tech-strategy-blog/bounded-context-canvas-v2-simplifications-and-additions-229ed35f825f) by Nick Tune (highly recommended blog btw).

## Prerequisites

Install the **Save Page WE** add-on/extension

- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/save-page-we/)
- [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-page-we/dhhpefjklgkmgeafimnjhojgjamoafof)

It allows you to save the current page (static html + data filled in) as an html file (which can live next to the bounded context's code).

Doing so allows one to re-open the saved html file and update the filled in data.

### Note for Chrome users

Once the extension is intalled, Chrome users need to do the following:

1. right clic on the extension's icon
1. "Manage extensions"
1. check "Allow access to file URLs"

## How to

- Either continue from a canvas you already started or start from the `bounded-context-canvas-template.html`.
- Fill it in with your team.
- Save the current page by clicking on the add-on/extension's icon and save it near the bounded context's code.
